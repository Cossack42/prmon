# Prmon Authors

- [Graeme A Stewart](https://github.com/graeme-a-stewart) refactored the code to make the utility stand alone,
renamed it as prmon (from MemoryMonitor) and worked on many further
enhancements.

- [Alaettin Serhan Mete](https://github.com/amete) added the code to measure timing stats (CPU/wall)
and worked on many additional improvements.

*Graeme and Serhan* continue to maintain prmon today.

- [Anubhab Das](https://github.com/quantum-shift) was a GSoC student who worked on prmon in 2021, developing
the logging infrastructure and the implementation of the "precooked" unit tests.
